# RobotOpen-RP3-Python-Library
A work in progress project to port the RobotOpen-HA-Library to the RP3 platform.

I like the RobotOpen libraries however, I really wanted to use a Raspberry Pi so I had a little more processing power and an easier time using a webcam. I wanted a cheaper platform to use to start teaching the basics of robotics vision processing and target tracking for our FRC team.
